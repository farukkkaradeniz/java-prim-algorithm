# java-prim-algorithm
Prim's algorithm takes a weighted, undirected, connected graph as input and returns an MST of that graph as output.  It works in a greedy manner. In the first step, it selects an arbitrary vertex. Thereafter, each new step adds the nearest vertex to the tree constructed so far until there is no disconnected vertex left.
